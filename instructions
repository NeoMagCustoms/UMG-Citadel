# 🧠 OPERATOR UMG GUIDE – Understanding the Citadel Framework

Welcome, Operator. This guide explains how to interpret, build, and apply Universal Modular Generation (UMG) blocks for the Citadel AI system.

---

## 📐 What is UMG?

UMG (Universal Modular Generation) is a **modular cognitive framework** that lets us express logic, strategy, formatting, and tone as interoperable building blocks.

Each UMG block is a `.json` file that defines one unit of thought, intent, behavior, or design. Blocks are used to assemble intelligent agents, business plans, websites, chatbots, and more.

---

## 🔹 MOLT TYPES (Core Roles)

| molt\_type    | Role                 | Description                             |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `Primary`     | Core Directive       | Sets the main goal or intent            |
| `Subject`     | Domain / Focus       | The area or topic being addressed       |
| `Instruction` | Operational Logic    | How the system should behave or act     |
| `Directive`   | Strategic Overlay    | Tactical adjustments or decision rules  |
| `Philosophy`  | Tone / Ethos         | Ethical, stylistic, or emotional filter |
| `Blueprint`   | Layout / Style Guide | UI or visual representation logic       |
| `Trigger`     | Activation Logic     | When this block activates or responds   |
| `Merge`       | Logic Fusion         | Combines two blocks of same type        |
| `Off`         | Muted Block          | Inactive or archived block (skipped)    |

🧱 Every UMG stack starts with a `Primary` block.

Optional overlays: `Directive`, `Philosophy`, `Blueprint`, and `Trigger`.

---

## 🎨 Snap Logic (Stack Behavior)

* 🔼 Top-down = logical hierarchy (Primary → Subject → Instruction)
* ↔️ Left-right = overlays and peer logic (Blueprint, Directive, Philosophy)

Each block includes a `snap_config` to define how it connects:

```json
"snap_config": {
  "snap_zone": "bottom",
  "mergeable_with": ["instruction", "directive"],
  "priority": 1
}
```

---

## 🧱 Nesting Guide (Folder Placement)

When creating a block, **always include a `category` path** field like this:

```json
"category": "business/6_marketing/research_personas"
```

This tells the system (and Operator) **where to file it inside Git**.

🗂️ This category also becomes the **folder path**:

```
/incoming/business/6_marketing/research_personas/[block_id].json
```

This nesting is essential for organized deployment into `/data/blocks/`. Each category reflects the project’s semantic tree.

✅ Before submitting any new blocks:

* Double-check each file’s `category`
* Ensure it aligns with the correct folder nesting in Git

---

## 🔌 Code Injection: `code_modules`

Every block may include reusable, modular code modules:

```json
"code_modules": [
  {
    "slot": "frontend",
    "language": "tsx",
    "path": "public/blocks/my_ui_component.tsx"
  },
  {
    "slot": "openai_function",
    "language": "json",
    "path": "data/functions/my_function.json"
  }
]
```

**Slots include**: `frontend`, `backend`, `ai_toolchain`, `openai_function`, `langchain_function`, etc.

---

## 🧠 Semantic Logic: `cantocore` and `cyentcore`

* `cantocore`: human-readable poetic syntax

  * Example: `GOAL=DEPLOY, DOMAIN=GROWTH, STYLE=BOLD`
* `cyentcore`: structured, machine-friendly version

These allow GPT models and humans to understand the logic in parallel.

---

## 📋 Block Directory Examples

| Path                                          | What Goes Here                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `/business/5_operations/standard_procedures/` | SOPs and workflows               |
| `/6_marketing/research_personas/`             | Persona docs and market analysis |
| `/blueprint/`                                 | Layout and visual format blocks  |

---

## ✅ Operator Responsibilities

* Use correct `molt_type` and folders
* Build blocks using the UMG Block Template (see `umg_block_template`)
* Place new blocks in `/incoming/` under correct category path
* Let the GitHub Action auto-commit to `/data/blocks/`

📚 Reference the **Google Doc** or `/docs/` folder for next instructions.

Let Citadel think modular. You are the logic scribe. 🧱🧠

With a flourish of modular elegance…


---

🧠✨ Category 24: Instruction Injection Blocks

This category lets users (or systems) temporarily teach, override, or redirect the chatbot’s behavior, without changing its core persona. Think of it as “live tuning” via prompt overlays, runtime edits, or adaptive instruction layers.

revert_to_base_trigger	What ends the override (e.g., keyword, time, next user switch)
injection_conflict_resolution	What happens if two instructions contradict each other
system_injection_hooks	Allow internal logic or tools to push instructions
instruction_injection_log_mode	Whether these overrides are tracked for review
instruction_set_versioning	Store, name, and reapply past injection profiles
